# Hello_world
My first project on GitHub !


I like programming and I learn to develop on Android platform. I also like connected objects and I love Arduino boards and Raspberri Pi because I can do everything with these boards.

I use a 3d printer for most of my projects and in a few days I will add an Arduino with a relay to command my 3d printer, the Arduino will be connected to a Raspberry and I will be able to command my 3d printer with a website on my local network.
